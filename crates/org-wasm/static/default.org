* Org-Rust
This is a parser and exporter for [[https://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]], powered by [[https://github.com/hydrobeam/org-rust][Org-Rust]].

The editor is running the parser locally within your browser using WebAssembly and the syntax highlighting is generated from the parse tree too!

Be sure to check out some of the default presets:

- *Showcase*: shows off (most of) what Org-Rust can do
- *Footnotes*: highlights the footnotes feature
- *Affiliated Keywords*: shows how to attach specific attributes to objects
- *Images*: playing around with images!
